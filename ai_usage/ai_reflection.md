# AI Usage Reflection

## 1. What I Asked the AI To Do
- Draft Python code for downloading S&P 500 data
- Suggest cleaning steps
- Recommend visualization types
- Help structure the GitHub repository
- Provide documentation templates

## 2. What the AI Generated
- Working yfinance API call code
- Data cleaning and saving examples
- Plotting code for time series and volatility
- README and folder structure templates

## 3. How I Evaluated or Corrected the Output
- Verified DataFrame structure
- Adjusted column names and filters
- Added daily returns and rolling volatility
- Ensured relative file paths
- Confirmed saved/reloaded data matched

## 4. Reflection
AI accelerated setup and boilerplate coding, but human oversight was required for:
- Data validation
- Analytical decisions
- Visualization interpretation

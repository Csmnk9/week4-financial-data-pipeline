# Week 4 Financial Data Pipeline – S&P 500 Analysis

This repository contains my Week 4 assignment for the Data Analysis module.  
The project demonstrates a complete, reproducible workflow for:

- Programmatically downloading financial data via the Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`)
- Cleaning and preparing the dataset
- Saving the cleaned data in multiple formats (CSV, Pickle, Parquet)
- Reloading and comparing file formats
- Creating meaningful visualizations of financial time series data
- Documenting the use of AI assistance in the workflow
